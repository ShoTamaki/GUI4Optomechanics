This is a Python GUI for analysing data mainly for optomechanics.

It requires the CustomTkinter package (https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter).

Data files should be stored in .h5 or .pickle format including metadata.

Data can be fitted with Gaussian or Lorentizian peak, or Fano dip.

Using those fitted curves, it can compute the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate g0/2pi.
